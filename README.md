# Guardian of the Forest - Game Upgrade

## Overview
**Guardian of the Forest** is an adventure strategy game where the player controls a magical log, the guardian of nature, as it works to restore a destroyed forest. This project aims to upgrade the original concept by introducing modern features, such as 3D graphics, dynamic environments, new abilities, and a deeper storyline. The goal is to retain the core gameplay while expanding on it with innovative mechanics to engage both new and returning players.

## Features
- **Dynamic Environments**: Levels that evolve as the player restores the forest, with changing weather and environments that impact gameplay.
- **Abilities**: The log character gains new powers at each stage to help restore nature and defend against threats.
- **Stage-Based Progression**: Five stages representing different phases of forest restoration, each with unique challenges and environments.
- **Boss Battles**: At the end of each stage, a powerful environmental threat, such as a forest fire or deforestation, must be defeated.
- **Resource Management**: Collect resources like water and sunlight to grow trees and protect the environment from damage.
- **Upgradeable Log Character**: As players progress, they can enhance the log's abilities to better defend and restore the forest.
